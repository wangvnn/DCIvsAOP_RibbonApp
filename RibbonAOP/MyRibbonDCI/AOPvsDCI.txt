DCI
 The focus is on readable, understandable code for use cases.
 
 user has in his or her head:

- The roles and interactions between them ("Transferring money involves moving money from a SourceAccount to a DestinationAccount");
- The domain objects ("I have a SavingsAccount and a CheckingAccount");
- The mapping between them ("I am going to do a money transfer from my SavingsAccount to my CheckingAccount")

The chair stands on three legs: roles and Interactions; domain Data; and the Context that maps between them.
